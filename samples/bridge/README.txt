Welcome to the ServiceMix Bridge Example
========================================

This example shows a bridge between the HTTP and JMS protocols,
with an XSLT transformation in between.

First start a ServiceMix server (if not already started) by running
  bin/servicemix
in the root dir of this ditribution.

To compile this sample, run:
  mvn install

It provides the Bridge Service Assembly:
  bridge-sa/target/bridge-sa-*.zip

To install and start this sample simply copy the bridge-sa/target/bridge-sa-*.zip
into ServiceMix hotdeploy folder.

You can then launch the client.html in your favorite browser
and send an HTTP request which will be transformed in a JMS
message.

To stop and uninstall this sample, remove the bridge-sa-*.zip from the ServiceMix
hotdeploy folder.

For more information on running this example please see:
