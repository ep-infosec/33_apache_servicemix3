Welcome to the Servicemix Loan Broker example
=============================================

This example is based on the great EIP book 
(http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ComposedMessagingExample.html).
It leverages the BPEL service engine, JMS binding component and some 
lightweight components provided by ServiceMix.

First start a ServiceMix server (if not already started) by running
  bin/servicemix
in the root dir of this ditribution.

This example depends on Apache ODE JBI Service Engine which has not been
released yet.  You will need to build it yourself (more informations at
http://incubator.apache.org/ode/getting-ode.html).  You will need to copy
the Service Engine installer to the install directory of this distribution
prior to the following instructions.

To compile this sample, run:
  mvn install

It provides the Loan Broker Service Assembly:
  loan-broker-sa/target/loan-broker-sa-*.zip

To install and start this sample simply copy the loan-broker-sa/target/loan-broker-sa-*.zip
into ServiceMix hotdeploy folder.

To test this sample, launch the following commands:
  ant run

To stop and uninstall this sample, remove the loan-broker-sa-*.zip from the ServiceMix
hotdeploy folder.

For more information on this example please see
