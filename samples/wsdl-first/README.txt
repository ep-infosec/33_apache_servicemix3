Welcome to ServiceMix WSDL design first example
===============================================

This example shows how to expose a service, beginning from the
WSDL, and exposing it over HTTP.

First start a ServiceMix server (if not already started) by running
  bin/servicemix
in the root dir of this distribution.

To compile this sample, run:
  mvn install

It provides the WSDL First Service Assembly:
  wsdl-first-sa/target/wsdl-first-sa-*.zip

To install and start this sample simply copy the wsdl-first-sa/target/wsdl-first-sa-*.zip
into ServiceMix hotdeploy folder.

You can browse the WSDL at
  http://localhost:8192/PersonService/main.wsdl

To stop and uninstall this sample, remove the wsdl-first-sa-*.zip from the ServiceMix
hotdeploy folder.

You can also open the client.html page in a browser
to send a request to the service.
